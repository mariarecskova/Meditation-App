# Meditation-App
Deployment: https://bepresent.netlify.app/
A small app for breathing and meditation with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
I am a yoga teacher and meditation practicioner myself, so I created this app. It is responsive to mobile devices, and in the next step I am adding a background music player and the background picture will be changeable.
